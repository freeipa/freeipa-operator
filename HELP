Subcommands:
  help                 Print out all this help description.
  test                 Execute the unit tests locally.
  manager              Build locally the controller binary.
  run                  Execute the controller locally watching the current cluster.
                       It needs to be logged in a cluster.
  lint                 Lint project files.
  dive                 Check the image layer sizes.

  container-build      Build the container image.
                       It uses IMG variable.
  container-push       Push the container image to the repository.
                       This is REQUIRED before do 'deploy-cluster'.
                       It uses IMG variable.

  install-crds         Install the CRD manifest into the cluster.
  uninstall-crds       Uninstall the CRD manifest.
  deploy-cluster       Deploy controller and CRDs into the cluster.
                       It uses IMG to define the container image that contain the controller.
  undeploy-cluster     Undeploy controller and CRDS from the cluster.
  deploy-kind          Deploy controller into a kind cluster.
                       It uses IMG to define the container image that contain the controller.
                       In this case if the image exists locally, that image will be used.
                       It creates a kind cluster if it does not exist.
                       It loads the local container image (and regenerate it).
  kind-tests           Launch the unit tests against the controller running into the kind cluster.
  kind-long-tests      Launch the unit tests which are marked as longtests.

  manifests            Regenerate config/rbac/base and config/crd/base

  sample-recreate      Regenerate the sample idm inside the current cluster.

Variables:
  IMG_BASE  The base name for the container image; Change the value for this variable if you
            want to use a different container image registry or scope; by default it is:
            IMG_BASE=quay.io/freeipa
  IMG       The container image reference such as quay.io/freeipa/freeipa-operator:latest
            If IMG_TAG variable is not overrided, the local tag used is 'dev-GIT_SHA'.
  SAMPLE    The configuration to be used using config/samples as base directory.
            # make SAMPLE=ephemeral-storage recreate-idm-sample
            Default is 'ephemeral-storage'
  DEFAULT_STORAGE  It is used for enabling hostpath and ephemeral storages when no
                   PersistentVolumeClaim Template is specified. It is used when
                   doing 'make run'
                   ** EXAMPLE
                   ** DEFAULT_STORAGE=hostpath make run
  CONTROLLER_ARGS  It allows to specify the arguments to be passed to the controller when
                   it is executed. Ir is used when doing 'make run'
                   ** EXAMPLE
                   ** CONTROLLER_ARGS="--default-storage hostpath" make run
  PASSWORD         It allows to specify the password for administrator and directory
                   service admin. It is used the same so far.
                   It must be specified when running ' make recreate-sample-idm'.
                   ** EXAMPLE
                   ** PASSWORD=Secret123 SAMPLE=ephemeral-storage make recreate-sample-idm
  CONFIG           The configuration to be used; by default 'default' is used, but
                   you can override setting it to 'default-hostpath'.
  WORKLOAD_IMAGE   Set the image to be used for the workload.
                   By default "quay.io/freeipa/freeipa-openshift-container:freeipa-server"
                   is used.
