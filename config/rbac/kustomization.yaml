  # TODO SecurityContextConstraint is not included into the bundle and
  # it fails when it is included; to align when operator is installed
  # by 'make deploy' and 'make bundle-install', the line below is
  # commented, so that it is needed to create the SecurityContextConstraint
  # before use the custom resources.
